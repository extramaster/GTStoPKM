GTS To .pkm Converter
=====================

 How to use?
 Well, grab the network data from your computer while you're using the recieve feature of any
 fakeGTS servers out there, and find a request which looks like the following:
 GET /pokemondpds/worldexchange/post.asp?pid=[PID]&hash=[HASH]&data=[DATA]

 Copy and paste everything from [DATA] and save it to a file, it should be in a base64 URL
 encoded format:

 Example: SjtWrwDenEDdV4Jy2ZqFjYoQWR_cONZuCCn2seSeXv3_3yvSPcerG1M9mU5KgrJCV4uipn68T_n30DTB71SA2P7Mfur1Z8psmuogAopyhnr0iXaEdUTqDO1ko2mXWAJK3K1nQSiAmvlqxpD0FsBq1BYW9q4QNR4jBbvJnbO6TEiHdwBqkNbE8ANkbjS6FngNcFDs-GG4a23qVmXDlp_fas28c1LBH9_mhsxlkdMOZ4AAt-cdZ-bpsuxWrHuSQtlaGGYWpMVYJQqaUVq82fbVRkTBc2Ay5XwxvnGuaK-sDefWztlWxwuo7-MsjFYekzZ2F3zvqEeFpBo2fXKvV5ft9UiareSfBxt1vf-7hf1Yu45k_7-lrJHUtZM1cPt3Q-HBP_1lYBEYbnPE_PxX

 Save that data to a file, launch the script and drag that file to the script, and press enter/return

 From there you should get a nice .pkm file from an ugly network string..
 
 Note, this script is currently only tested on the 4th Generation of Pokemon 
 [Pokemon diamond/pearl] ans so is largerly incompatiable with newer generations such as
 Pokemon black
